# Generative AI in ASPICE

@Bosch Global Software Development, Bengaluru, India in the role of SOM (Strategy and Operations Manager)

I oversaw a 19-person software engineering team while collaborating with management to identify new business opportunities within the R\&D division. In the sensors component division of Bosch, I was tasked with leading a program that would reduce software development operational expenses.

**Operational Efficiency Strategies**

* Integrated Generative AI throughout the ASPICE Model lifecycle, from ideation and concept design through MVP development to continuous monitoring and user feedback incorporation
* Identified operational bottlenecks in existing workflows and implemented a real-time performance dashboard delivering automated daily insights
* Established an intelligent efficiency management system to support departments and streamline operations

**Business Strategy Development**

*
* Evaluated emerging technology trends including centralized automotive architecture, virtual ECUs, and synthetic data management to integrate long-term planning
* Monitored employee development and capability growth in emerging technology areas

**Cross-Functional Leadership**

* Coordinated cross-functional teams by establishing agendas, facilitating workshops, driving brainstorming sessions, and tracking action items
* Created and managed JIRA backlogs using user stories and documented progress in Confluence
* Presented operational efficiency and business metrics (cost, quality, timeline) to senior management for strategic decision-making

I utilized Power BI and QLIK to automate the integration of new data and generate insightful visualizations

My inspiration was drawn from John Kotter's 8 Principles of Change for executing innovation and organizational transformation.&#x20;

Further the strategy incorporated a three-pillar framework—encompassing political, technical, and training elements—designed to advance these pillars in parallel to maximize the impact of organizational change.
